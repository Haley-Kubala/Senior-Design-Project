Senior Design Project - 2017

Our goal for the project is to create a small device that allows teachers
to keep track of how long people use the hall pass, how often, as well as who 
uses the pass. Other features could be added if we have time to do so. 

Creators : Haley Kubala, Annie Williamson, David Roherbaugh 

The Device utilizes an arduino, a raspberry pi, and a lcd touch screen.
We will be 3D printing the case that contains all of the parts. 

Software Components : we will need to create a database, preferably a mongo
database to store all of the information for each student. There will need to 
be code written to handle retrieving information from the touch screen, 
storing that information in the database, updating the information. At the 
moment this is all I can think of, but I'm sure there will need to be more
software written to tackle this. 

The software will be written in Python.
